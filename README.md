# CRUD App with MongoDB, Axios & MUI

This is a simple full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project built as a learning exercise. It uses **MongoDB** as the database, **Axios** for HTTP requests, and **Material-UI (MUI)** for the user interface.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database
- **Express.js** â€“ Backend framework
- **React.js** â€“ Frontend library
- **Axios** â€“ For making API calls
- **Material-UI (MUI)** â€“ UI components
- **Concurrently** â€“ To run both frontend and backend together
